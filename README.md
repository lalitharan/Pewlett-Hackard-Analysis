Pewlett-Hackard HR department.

## Results:

1) List of retiring employees

## Summary:

PH has currently 300024 employees , Out of those employees 72458 will be retiring  when filtered on the employee birth date between '01-01-1952' and '12-31-1955'. 
24% of the employee work force will be retiring creating 72458 job opportunities if the company plans to hire a person for each job role.
There are 1549 mentorship eligible employees available in PH.
Additionally, a table is created with a list of  retiring employees and their title counts by department, so the HR can analyze the results and figure out which departments
would require immediate filling and for which job titles.. A similar analysis is done for Mentorship eligibility employees by department and titles which would help the HR department to 
make decisions for the mentorship program.
